<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
This repo contains notes and code snippets for setting
up Ubuntu 16.04 machines, usually running as VirtualBox
guests.
Most of
the notes are about setting up guests running the desktop
environment, but some of them are for setting up servers,
and some of them are just random scraps of information
that I want to write down before I forget them.
</p>

<p>
Some of the Ubuntu-related notes are applicable to other
Debian-based releases, but I'll only claim to have tested
any of this on Ubuntu 16.04, except where noted.
</p>

<p>
Many of these notes are about how to change the default
behavior of Ubuntu to a behavior I prefer.
This, of course, is both a matter of opinion and a reflection
of the types of things I do with my computers, which are
not entirely mainstream.
Therefore, it is entirely believable that you, or your users,
might have different preferences; feel free to let
me know if you have different or additional suggestions,
or send me a pull request.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to premptively thank the many, many people who
created, maintain, and make available
Ubuntu, Debian, and all the other pieces of software I mention
in these notes.  Even though it might seem like I spend a lot
of time complaining things I don't like about it, there's
much more that I think is superb.
