<h1>Window Borders</h1>

<p> The default desktop theme does not put borders on windows (except
for the title bar).  This can be annoying if you spend a lot of
time with Terminal instances tiling your screen (or using some other
application that uses a black background and didn't create any other
sort of window border, because it's hard to tell where one window
ends and the next begins.  If you prefer to resize your windows by
grabbing a corner and stretching/shrinking it, you're also out of
luck.  </p>

<p> Fortunately, fixing this is straightforward, at least for the
default theme. </p>

<p> Edit (as sudo)
<kbd>/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css</kbd>
(or the corresponding file, if you are using a different
theme than Ambiance), and change the line, very near the top,
that looks like: </p>

<pre>
	-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 0 0 0;
</pre>

<p> to: </p>

<pre>
	-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 4 4 4;
</pre>

<p>
If the resulting borders are too wide or too thin, change each 4 to
whatever value you prefer.
</p>

<p>
The change will take effect the next time the theme is restarted
(i.e. by logging out and logging in again).
