<h1>Disable the Guest Account from the Desktop</h1>

<p> For most of my machines, there's no need for a guest account,
and having a guest account makes me (and auditors) nervous.  
</p>

<p> Edit (as sudo)
<kbd>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-no-guest.conf</kbd>
so that it contains:

<pre>
[Seat:*]
    allow-guest=false
</pre>

<p>
Note: prior to 15.10, Ubuntu used <kbd>[SeatDefaults]</kbd> instead
of <kbd>[Seat:*]</kbd>.  Either seems to work equally well for 16.04,
but the older format will probably stop working in some future release.
</p>

<p>
The change will take effect the next time the login screen is
activated.
</p>

<p> To reenable the guest account, remove 
<kbd>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-no-guest.conf</kbd> (or replace
it with an empty file, or comment out the changes).
