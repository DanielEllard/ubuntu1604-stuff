<h1>Basic UI Setup</h1>

<p> This describes some changes I always seem to end up making to
the default UI.  It might be possible to script these, but I haven't
investigated; it's easy enough to do this from the UI itself. </p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="window-borders.htm">Add borders to the windows</a> </li>

    <li> Change the default <kbd>Terminal</kbd> profile to use the
	"XTerm" color palette instead of the defaults, because the
	default palette doesn't interact with some curses applications
	(it contrast is low, giving the apps a sort of grey-on-grey
	color scheme). </li>

    <li> For VMs, turn off the screen lock (and possibly the screen
	blanking) unless you actually need it.  If the desktop is
	is running on a VM displayed on another desktop, let the
	exterior screen lock and blanking do the work. Otherwise
	you'll end up typing your password twice all the time. </li>

    <li> Add the Terminal icon to the dock,
	and remove most/all of the LibreOffice icons,
	and the Amazon icon, unless you
	actually plan to use them often. </li>

</ul>
