<h1>Installing Essential Packages</h1>

<p> Some important packages are not installed during 
the ordinary installation procedure.
</p>

<p>
Following a fresh install from media:
</p>

<pre>
# make sure that your package database is up-to-date
sudo apt update
# upgrade any packages that aren't the most recent
# (you can be selective, if there are packages that
# you want to hold back)
sudo apt upgrade
# remove any packages that are no longer necessary
sudo apt autoremove

# install the basic tool-chain
sudo apt install build-essential

# install ntp, with a basic configuration
# (you might want to modify it later)
sudo apt install ntp

# If you plan to do any network diagnostics:
sudo apt install tcpdump traceroute

# Tools I like, but you might not care about
sudo apt install vim vile git
sudo apt install pep8 python-dev pylint
sudo apt install python3-dev pylint3

# gitk is nice, but drags in a lot of other stuff
sudo apt install gitk
</pre>
